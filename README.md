# CHIP-8 Emulator
A C++ version of the [CHIP-8 Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).</br>
For this implementation I've consulted the [Cowgods's CHIP-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#00E0), but might be slightly different for some opcodes. Roms that you can find in the internet aren't written in the same way due the multiple extensions developed in the years.</br>
To manage the graphics I've used the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) Library.
